# Polynom
My object oriented project.
In this project i created a math polynomial using several classes. The polynomial consists of monomials.
Also in this project there are tests of all functions. 
My polynom is able:
      •add polynom
      •subtruct polynom
      •multiply polynom by polynom
      •derivative polynom
      •check if two polynoms are equals
      •find root
      •count area
      •print polynom 
You can create your own polynom and see him on graph with minimum and maximum points.
